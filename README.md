# Customer Segmentation using K-Means

This project applies K-Means clustering to segment credit card customers based on
their credit limits and interaction patterns with the bank.

### Tech Stack
- Python
- Pandas / NumPy
- Scikit-Learn
- Matplotlib / Seaborn

### Objective
Identify meaningful customer segments to support:
- targeted marketing
- customer retention
- product strategy

### Key Steps
1. Data cleaning and exploratory data analysis  
2. Outlier handling and feature scaling  
3. K-Means clustering and cluster evaluation  
4. PCA visualization  
5. Business interpretation of clusters  
6. Saving model for reuse

### Results
The model identified three customer segments:
- High-value digital customers
- Traditional moderate users
- Low-credit, high-support customers
